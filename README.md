# Plot
A simple CSS framework containing a set of declaration classes shortened by their initials, similar to tailwindcss.

**Installation using CDN**:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/sketnext/plot@latest/plot.min.css">
```

For example, for this html element:
```html
<div class="df br5 pt10 mb7">
```

For this html element, the declarations applied would be the following (note that the classes are shortened declarations)
```css
display: flex;
boder-radius: 5px;
padding-top: 10px;
margin-bottom: 7px;
```

I will post some GIFs here....
